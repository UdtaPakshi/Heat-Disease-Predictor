# Heat-Disease-Predictor

Welcome to my heart disease predictor model repository! I'm thrilled to present a predictive tool using logistic regression. With this project, I've learned about training and testing a powerful machine learning model.

By analyzing various patient attributes, my model provides predictions on whether an individual is likely to have heart disease or not. This endeavor is crucial as it has the potential to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing this critical health condition promptly.
